## HW1

Homework 1 examines the application of affine transformation operations on an image. The code performs image scaling, rotation and shearing operations without using external libraries. This report aims to provide an in-depth understanding of how image processing techniques can be applied, supported by relevant code snippets and visual examples.

## Digital Image Processing Project: Cancer Cell Count

This project aims to prove that accurate cell counting can be achieved without relying on external libraries, making the process more transparent and customizable. By working through the fundamentals, this approach also provides a deeper understanding of the steps involved in image processing, which can be useful for adapting the method to different types of data or challenges.
